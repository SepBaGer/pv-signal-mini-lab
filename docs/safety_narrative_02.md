# Safety Narrative: Methadone and Respiratory Depression

**Date:** 2024-12-23
**Subject:** Signal Evaluation - Methadone and Respiratory Depression
**Source:** PV Mini-Lab Simulated Database (N=2000)

## 1. Safety Concern

Potential signal of **Respiratory Depression** associated with the use of **Methadone**.

## 2. Signal Detection Results

- **Metric:** PRR > 2.0 (Detected)
- **Case Count (a):** Significant cluster observed (simulated).
- **Comparator:** Buprenorphine, Morphine, Oxycodone

## 3. Case Series Review (Representative)

### Case ID: CASE-1102

- **Demographics:** 45-year-old Female.
- **Suspect Drug:** Methadone.
- **Event:** Respiratory depression, Sedation.
- **Narrative Summary:** Patient found unresponsive with slow breathing. Emergency services administered Naloxone. Patient recovered.
- **Context:** High risk inherent to opioid agonist class.

## 4. Discussion

Respiratory depression is the primary risk of opioid overdose. The signal analysis shows Methadone has a reporting ratio consistent with this class effect, potentially elevated in this simulation due to higher weights assigned during data generation.

## 5. Recommendation

- Reinforce importance of dose titration.
- **Disclaimer:** Simulated data. No real patients involved.
