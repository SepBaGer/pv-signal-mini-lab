# Safety Narrative: Methadone and QT Prolongation

**Date:** 2024-12-23
**Subject:** Signal Evaluation - Methadone and QT Prolongation
**Source:** PV Mini-Lab Simulated Database (N=2000)

## 1. Safety Concern

Potential signal of **QT Prolongation** associated with the use of **Methadone**.

## 2. Signal Detection Results

- **Metric:** PRR > 2.0 (Detected)
- **Case Count (a):** 257 cases
- **Comparator:** Buprenorphine, Morphine, Oxycodone

## 3. Case Series Review (Representative)

*Case selection based on index cases from simulated dataset.*

### Case ID: CASE-0254

- **Demographics:** 62-year-old Male.
- **Suspect Drug:** Methadone (Indication: Opioid dependence).
- **Event:** QT Prolongation (Serious: Yes).
- **Concomitants:** None reported.
- **Narrative Summary:** Patient initiated Methadone. 14 days later, reported palpitations and was found to have prolonged QTc interval on ECG. Methadone was discontinued. Recovered.
- **Causality Assessment (Simulated):** The temporal association is plausible. Dechallenge positive.

## 4. Medical Assessment

Methadone is known to inhibit the hERG potassium channel, which can lead to QT interval prolongation. The signal observed in the mini-lab (a=257) is consistent with the known safety profile of the drug. The high ROR/PRR confirms a statistical disproportion compared to other opioids in the dataset.

## 5. Recommendation

- Continue routine monitoring.
- Ensure label warnings regarding QT prolongation are adhered to.
- **Disclaimer:** This is a simulated finding for educational purposes only.
